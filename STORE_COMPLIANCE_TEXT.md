# Draft App Store / Play Store Medical Compliance Text (Copy-Paste)

## App description (safe wording)
BUBULIZER Kidney Triage is an educational decision-support tool that helps users organize symptoms and lab results (kidney function, infection markers) into a clinician-ready summary. It highlights urgency signals and prompts follow-up questions (e.g., repeat blood culture/speciation). It does not provide prescriptions and does not replace clinical evaluation.

## Medical disclaimer (in-app, first launch)
This tool is for education and decision support only. It does not diagnose disease or prescribe treatment. If you have danger signs (high fever, confusion, fainting/very low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, very low urine output, severe weakness), seek urgent medical care immediately. Always consult a licensed clinician for diagnosis and treatment.

## What the app does NOT do
- No antibiotic prescriptions or dosing
- No emergency triage replacement
- No guarantees of accuracy

## Privacy (safe default)
By default, data stays on-device. Do not enter names, phone numbers, addresses, or any identifying information. If you enable cloud features, you are responsible for your own compliance and consent workflows.

## “Regulatory” positioning (important)
Educational medical reference / decision-support. Not a diagnostic medical device.
